<h1 class="display-4">Why Coding is really important?</div>
  <p><h6>Coding, or computer programming, is vital in today's digital age because it powers the technology that drives our world. From smartphones and websites to artificial intelligence and robotics, coding is the foundation that enables these systems to function. Learning to code not only allows individuals to create and understand technology but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It teaches people how to break down complex problems into manageable steps and find efficient solutions. Furthermore, as automation and artificial intelligence grow, coding skills will become increasingly valuable in the job market, ensuring that those who can code remain competitive and adaptable to technological changes. In short, coding is a key skill for navigating and shaping the future.</h6></p>
